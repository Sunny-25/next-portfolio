		title: "Biography",
		desc: 'Nahid was born on 28th April of 1999 in the beautiful city of Gazipur in Bangladesh, where he currently lives with his family. His father got him his first computer at the age of 10. It was mostly used for playing video games, thanks to the widespread "unavailability" of the Internet. What used to make him thrill more than the fun playing games was their mechanism, e.g. how it was working, how a tap in the keyboard could get so many "physically untouchable" things done. When he got an Internet connection, he would research day and night in order to find the answers of his questions, gradually turning himself into a clog of the machines. Over a couple failed pet projects in school, he came to know about WordPress and fell in love with it, followed by php and modern javascript.',
